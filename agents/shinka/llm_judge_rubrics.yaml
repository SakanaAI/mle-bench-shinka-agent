rubrics:
- Are there any serious bugs in the implementation? Ignore non-critical details, e.g., edge cases that are unlikely to happen. Focus on logical flaws and possible data leakage.
- Is there possible data leakage or contamination in the implementation?
- Does the implementation contain proper spliting of training between validation data and prevent data leakage?
- Does the implementation standardize preprocessing in a pipeline and avoid target-aware transforms?
- Does the implementation balance under/overfitting?
